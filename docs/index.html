<h2>About Me</h2>
I am a PhD candidate at the University of Michigan in the Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics (DCMB). Most of my research centers on computational methods for precision medicine. Currently, I am working with Dr. Arvind Rao to integrate multimodal data into machine learning frameworks. I have experience from my previous lab in signal processing of ECG signals, as well as some image processing of CT scans. I’ve also worked with stock market prediction and financial data.

I previously worked as a Data Engineer at a startup called Elevada. Elevada was a data automation company. that featured a software called Curator, which provided tools for automated and quick data preparation.  Our primary customers were in big pharma and healthcare analytics. We were also linked to the i2b2 TranSMART Foundation, which works to promote clean, open-source translational and -omic data.

For Elevada, I worked on creating an algorithm involving Amazon Sagemaker’s machine learning platform, using AWS S3 features to build models in Python online. I have also worked with Bioinformatics APIs to enrich data using our software and visualized interesting findings in Tableau and Spotfire. Although most of these were company property, I have a small sample visualization in Projects under Elevada.

<h2>Research Interests</h2>
Based on both my academic and industrial experience, I’ve found machine learning, deep learning, AI, natural language processing, and image processing to be the highly-anticipated future of healthcare. I’m interested in applying these methods myself to precision medicine to better predict patient outcomes.

In particular, I’m interested in building the right mathematical models that can integrate multimodal data across platforms, from genetics to histopathology to radiomics. I’m also interested in models which incorporate fuzzy learning, label uncertainty, active learning, and especially privileged information.

If you are interested in working with me on a project, please feel free to contact me via my Contact page.

<h2>Why I’m Cool</h2>
* I have played the Rainbow Road course on Mario Kart 8 at 200cc without falling off
* The pronunciation of my first and last name is iambic
* I liked Harry Potter so much as a kid that I once made a broomstick out of paper so I could play Quidditch
* I can name all 50 states in less than 20 seconds (thanks to 3rd grade)
