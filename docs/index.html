<h2>About Me</h2>
Currently, I am a Staff Machine Learning Scientist at Visa in Value-Added Services, building fraud detection models for real-time payment networks. Visa is a payment network organization (now corporation) which handles safe and secure payments for every cardholder across the world in the Visa payment network.

For my background, I graduated with an MS and PhD from the University of Michigan in the Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics (DCMB). Most of my research centered on developing machine learning methods in precision medicine with small sample sizes. I also have a Master in Public Health in Hospital & Molecular Epidemiology, which gave me expertise in experiment/project design, as well as scientifically-sound statistical strategies for interpreting data while ameliorating bias.

I previously worked as a Data Engineer at a startup called Elevada. Elevada was a data automation company. that featured a software called Curator, which provided tools for automated and quick data preparation.  Our primary customers were in big pharma and healthcare analytics. We were also linked to the i2b2 TranSMART Foundation, which works to promote clean, open-source translational and -omic data.

For Elevada, I worked on creating an algorithm involving Amazon Sagemakerâ€™s machine learning platform, using AWS S3 features to build models in Python online. I have also worked with Bioinformatics APIs to enrich data using our software and visualized interesting findings in Tableau and Spotfire. Although most of these were company property, I have a small sample visualization in Projects under Elevada.
