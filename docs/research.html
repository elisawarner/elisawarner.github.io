<h2>Research Interests</h2>
Based on both my academic and industrial experience, I’ve found machine learning, deep learning, AI, natural language processing, and image processing to be the highly-anticipated future of healthcare. I’m interested in applying these methods myself to precision medicine to better predict patient outcomes.

In particular, I’m interested in building the right mathematical models that can integrate multimodal data across platforms, from genetics to histopathology to radiomics. I’m also interested in models which incorporate fuzzy learning, label uncertainty, active learning, and especially privileged information.

If you are interested in working with me on a project, please feel free to contact me via my Contact page.
